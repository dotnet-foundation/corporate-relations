# Welcome to the Sponsorship Committee
The sponsorship committee is here to help engage and grow corporate sponsors.  We are committed to providing value to our corporate sponsors that help fund the operation of the .NET Foundation.  We are focused on initiatives that help provide sponsors with opportunities to engage and inform the .NET community, and growing that community through corporate membership.
